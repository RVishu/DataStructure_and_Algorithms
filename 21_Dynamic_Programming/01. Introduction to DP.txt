 optiimizaation over plain recursion

 here we are given a problem of input size =n
 we use sub-problem solution when there are Overlapping of sub-problems


 THER ARE 2 WAYS TO IMPLEMENTATE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
    1- memoization (Top Down)
    2-tabulation    (Bottom Up)



APPLICATION
    1-bellman Ford Algorithm
    2-Floyd Warshall Algorithm
    3-Diff utility (LCS== Longest Common Subsequenc)
    4-Search closed words
    5-Resource Allocation (0-1 Knapsack)
