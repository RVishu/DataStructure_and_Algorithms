// background - same set of keys can make different height BSTs
/*
if we know keys in ADVANCE , we can make a perfectly balanced BST

how to keep it balancing when random insertion or deletion happening?
    - the idea is to do some restructing or re-balancing when doing insertion/deletion.


    -> LEFT ROTAION
    -> RIGHT ROTATION


   SELF BALANCING TREE
        - AVL TREE
        - RED BLACK TREE
