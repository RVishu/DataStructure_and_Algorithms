TYPICAL STRUCTURE OF RECURSIVE FUCTION

.....(return type ) fun (.....)
{
    Base Case
    .........

    Recursive call(i.e call to fun() )
    with at least one change in parameter.
    .........
}


//  any programme which can be programmed using ITERATION can also be programmed using RECURSION and vice-versa.

APPLICATION OF RECURSION

(1) many algorithms techniques are based on RECURSION

--> DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
--> BACKTRACKING
-->DIVIDE AND CONQUER (binary search,quick sort, and merge sort)


(2)  many problems inherently Recursive
--> tower of hanoi
--> DFS based traverials(DFS of graph and Inorder/Preorder/Pastorder traverial of tree)
