maximum no. of activities that can happen on a single tasking machine


I/P : {(3,8),(2,4),(1,3),(10,11)}

1- sort according to finish time:  // nlogn t.c
    {(1,3),(2,4),(3,8),(10,11)}

2- initialize solution as first activity  // constant t.c

3- Do following for remaining activities  // O(n-1)

    a-if current activity overlaps with the last 
        picked activity in the solution,ignore the current activities

    b- Else add the current activity to the solution.          


    // overall t.c is O(nlogn)
