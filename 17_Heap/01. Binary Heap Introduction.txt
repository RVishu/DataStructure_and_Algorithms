BINARY HEAP

- used in heapsort
-used to implement priority queue

->two ways
        -min heap(highest priority items is assigned lowest value)

        -max heap (highest priority item is assigned highest value)


BINARY HEAP is a complete Binary Tree(Stored as an array)- if last row is filled from left to right , (there should no gap)

 left(i)=2i+1

 right(i)=2i+2

parent(i)=[i-1/2]



// MIN HEAP 
    -complete Binary Tree

    - every node has value smaller thhan its Descendent
