if we know keys in advance , then we can PERFECT HASHING (which gurantee NO collision)

if we do not know keys ,then we use one of the following
        - chaining
        - open addressing
            - linear probling
            - quadratic probling
            - double hashing

BIRTHDAY PARADOX 
    - 23 -> 50%
    - 70 -> 99.9%
