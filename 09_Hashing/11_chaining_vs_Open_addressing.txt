CHAINING  --> it better handle collision
    - hash table never fills
    - less senstive to hash function
    - poor cache performance
    - extra space for links


OPEN ADDRESSING
    - table may become full and resizing becomes mandatory
    - extra care required for clustering
    - cache friendly
    - extra space might be needed to achieve same performance as chaining.
