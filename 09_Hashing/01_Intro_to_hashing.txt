/*


it is mainly used to implement dictionaries-> where we have key value pairs
it is also used to implement sets of keys
-> it provides SEARCH ,INSERT, DELETE  in O(1 ) on Average
-> in hashing or hash table we always have unique values

=>> Not useful for 
    1-finding closest value   /
    2-sorted data
    3-prefix searching (HASHIG DOES EXACTLY SEARCH)

    for 1 and 2 we will use AVL TREE or RED BLACK TREE
    for 3 there is TRIE data structure
