DAG- Directed Acyclic Graph
O(V+E)


shortestapth(adj,s)
    1-initialize dist[v]={INF,INF,...,INF}
    2-dist[s]=0
    3-find a topological sort of the graph
    4-for every vertex u in the topological sort    
        a-for every adjacent v of u 
            if dist[v]>dist[u] + weight(u,v)
                dist[v]= dist[u]+weight(u,v)
