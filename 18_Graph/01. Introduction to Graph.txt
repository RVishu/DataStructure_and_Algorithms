DIRECTED VS UNDIRECTED GRAPH

UNDIRECTED GRAPH
    - DEGREE(v3) - degree of vertice is number of edges going through it.
    - sum of degree = 2 *|E|
    - maximum number of edges = (|v|*(|v|-1))/2
                                                                                                                     
DIRECTED GRAPH
    - INDEGREE(V3)=1
    - outdegree (v3)=2

    -sum of indegrees = |E|
    -sum of outdegrees = |E|

    Maximum number of Edges = |v|*(|v|-1)  


WALK (path) : V1 .V2 ,V4,V2

PATH (simple path) : V1 ,V2 ,V4  (special walk wiht no repitation)

CYCLIC: there exists a walk that begins 
        and ends with same vertices.
