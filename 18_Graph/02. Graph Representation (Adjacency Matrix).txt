ADJACENCY MATRIX
    size of matrix = |v|*|v|
    |v| -> number of vertices

    for undirected GRAPH
        - it is symmetric matrix

mat[i][j]=         1  - if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j
                   0  - otherwise


HOW TO HANDLE VERTICES WITH ARBITARY NAMES ?
    - an array of strings


    for efficient implementation,

    one hash table h would also be required to do reverse mapping                    


  Properties of Adjacency matrix
  representation

  Space Required = theta(v*v)

  Operations:
    check if u and v  are adjacent : theta(1)
    find all vertices adjacent to u : theta(v)
    find degree of u : theta(v)
    Add/Remove on Edge :  theta(1)
    Add/Remove a Vertex : theta(v2)
