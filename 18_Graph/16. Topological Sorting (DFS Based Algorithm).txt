1- Create an Empty stack st
2- for every vertex u , do following 
    if(u is not visited)
        DFS(u,st)
3-while(st is not empty)
    pop an item from st and print it


DFS(u,st)
    1-mark u as visited
    2-for every adjacent v of using
        if(v is not visited)
            DFS(v,st)
    3-push u to st            

    //O(V+E)
