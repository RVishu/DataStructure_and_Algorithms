we are given a directed graph,
we need to find all the strongly conncected componenet in it

Strategy - if we go backward  or say Sink(last) to Source(src)


1- Order the vertices in decreasing order of finish times in DFS

2-Reverse all edges

3- Do DFS of the Reversal graph in the order obtained in sstep 1
    for every vertex,print all reachable vertices as one strongly Connected componenet
