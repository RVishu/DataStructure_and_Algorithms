adjacent List : it stores value only whivh are connected
    - we only store vertices which are adjacent to it.

An array of lists where

lists are most popular represented as:
    - Dynamic Sized Arrays
    - Linked lists

Space : theta (V+E) 
    - undirected  - (V+2*Edge)
    - directed  - (V + E)


Operations:

check if there is an edge from u to v : O(v)

find all adjacent of u : theta(degree(u))

find degree of u : theta(1)

Add on Edge : theta(1)

Remove an Edge : O(v)
