/*
-> divide and coquer algo (it first divide in two parts then sort them independently)
- it partition but they need not to be of same size.
- in mege sort merge function is complex ans in quick sort , partion function is complex
-> worst case is O(n^2) ,still it is consider than faster than merge sort
  because
  - In Place (it require aulixiary space for recurtion function call Stack)
  -cache Friendly
  -Averge case is O(nlogn)
  -Tail Recursive
-> Partion is key function (Naive{Stable},Lomuto,Hoare)
